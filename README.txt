Hello, whoever might be reading this
for whatever reason. I made this 
automated game of tic tac toe to help
with my ruby skills.

At the time of me writing this README
I am sure there is a more eligant way 
of writing his code, but I am happy to 
say that it does work does what I intended
it to do.
  
woo hoo

If you have any comments about how
I can improve this code, feel free to 
send an email to andy.linteau@gmail.com.

I would appreciate any feedback.

Thanks
